        <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
        <p>
            This authentic pho isn't quick, but it is delicious. 
            The key is in the broth, which gets simmered for at least 6 hours.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds beef soup bones</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>2 pods star anise</li>
            <li>2.5 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>4 quarts water</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles</li>
            <li>1.5 pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>0.5 cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion</li>
            <li>1.5 cups bean sprouts</li>
            <li>1 bunch Thai basil</li>
            <li>1 lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
            <li>0.25 cup hoisin sauce (Optional)</li>
            <li>0.25 cup chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha) (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.</li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <li>Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a 
                large stockpot and cover with 4 quarts of water. Bring to a boil and 
                reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for 6 to 10 hours. 
                Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <li>Place rice noodles in large bowl filled with room temperature water 
                and allow to soak for 1 hour. Bring a large pot of water to a boil 
                and after the noodles have soaked, place them in the boiling water 
                for 1 minute. Bring stock to a simmer.</li>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <li>Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, 
                and green onion. Pour hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until 
                the beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve 
                with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic 
                sauce on the side.</li>
